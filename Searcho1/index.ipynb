First off, I need to understand what a capital-intensive business is. I think it means a company that requires a lot of initial investment in physical assets like property, plant, and equipment to operate. So, for 3M, which is a multinational corporation that operates in various industries like manufacturing, health care, consumer goods, and more, I need to see how much they invest in assets relative to their sales or revenue.\\n\\nI recall that in finance, there are ratios that can help determine how capital-intensive a company is, like the fixed assets to sales ratio or the capital intensity ratio. Maybe I should look into those. I need to find 3M\\'s financial statements for FY2022 to get the necessary data. Specifically, I\\'ll need their balance sheet and income statement to find the total assets and sales figures.\\n\\nI should probably start by finding 3M\\'s annual report for FY2022. Annual reports usually contain all the financial statements and notes that I might need. Maybe I can search for \"3M FY2022 annual report\" or something similar. Once I have the annual report, I can look for the balance sheet to find the total assets and the income statement to find the sales or revenue figure.\\n\\nAlso, it might be helpful to compare 3M\\'s capital intensity with other companies in the same industry to see how it stacks up. That way, I can get a better perspective on whether it\\'s considered high or low in its sector.\\n\\nWait, I should define what constitutes a capital-intensive business. Is there a specific threshold for the fixed assets to sales ratio or another metric that classifies a company as capital-intensive? I might need to research that.\\n\\nMaybe I should look for articles or resources that explain how to determine if a company is capital-intensive. That could give me a framework to follow.\\n\\nAdditionally, since 3M operates in multiple industries, their capital intensity might vary across different segments. If possible, I should look into the breakdown of their assets and sales by business segment.\\n\\nI should also consider other financial metrics that might indicate capital intensity, such as depreciation expenses, which would suggest a significant investment in fixed assets.\\n\\nOverall, my plan is to:\\n\\n1. Find 3M\\'s FY2022 annual report to get the balance sheet and income statement.\\n\\n2. Calculate the fixed assets to sales ratio or another relevant capital intensity ratio.\\n\\n3. Compare 3M\\'s capital intensity with industry standards or competitors.\\n\\n4. Consider the breakdown of assets and sales by business segment if available.\\n\\n5. Look for any additional financial metrics that can support my analysis.\\n\\nTo execute this plan, I need to perform some searches to find the required information. So, I\\'ll need to specify search queries for:\\n\\n- 3M FY2022 annual report\\n\\n- Capital intensity ratios and how to calculate them\\n\\n- 3M\\'s industry peers and their capital intensity\\n\\nI think that\\'s a good starting point.
