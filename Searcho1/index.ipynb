      "2. **Define Capital-Intensive:**  A capital-intensive business requires significant investment in fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment - PP&E) to generate revenue.  Key indicators often involve comparing capital expenditures to revenue or looking at the proportion of fixed assets on the balance sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Initial Search Strategy:**  The most direct approach is to search for information specifically stating whether 3M is capital-intensive.  If that fails, searching for 3M's financial data for 2022 will be necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **First Search Attempt:**\n",
      "   <|begin_search_query|>is 3M a capital intensive business 2022<|end_search_query|>\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Analyze Search Results (Simulated):**  Assume the search results provide some general information about 3M but don't definitively answer the capital-intensive question.  They might point to 3M's investor relations page or financial news articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Second Search Attempt (If Necessary):** If the first search is inconclusive, a more targeted search for financial data is needed.\n",
      "   <|begin_search_query|>3M financial statements 2022<|end_search_query|>\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Analyze Search Results (Simulated):** Assume this search yields links to 3M's official investor relations website, specifically their annual report or SEC filings (like the 10-K).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Request Full Page Content:**  The best source for detailed financial data is 3M's official filings.\n",
      "   <|begin_url|> [Hypothetical URL to 3M's 2022 10-K or annual report] <|end_url|>\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Analyze Full Page Content (Simulated):**  Once the content is retrieved, look for key financial metrics:\n",
      "    * **Capital Expenditures (CapEx):**  This is the direct investment in fixed assets.\n",
      "    * **Revenue:**  To compare CapEx against.\n",
      "    * **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E):**  The total value of fixed assets.\n",
      "    * **Total Assets:** To see the proportion of PP&E.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Calculate Ratios and Make a Judgment:**\n",
      "    * **CapEx to Revenue Ratio:**  A higher ratio suggests more capital intensity.  There's no strict threshold, but generally, a ratio above 10-15% might indicate capital intensity, depending on the industry.\n",
      "    * **PP&E to Total Assets Ratio:** A higher percentage indicates a larger portion of assets tied up in fixed assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Consider Industry Context:**  Manufacturing companies like 3M often have significant investments in equipment, making them more capital-intensive than, say, a software company.  However, compare 3M to other manufacturing companies to get a better sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Formulate the Answer:** Based on the data and comparisons, determine if 3M fits the definition of a capital-intensive business.  Acknowledge the nuances and provide the supporting data.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. **Refine the Answer:** Ensure the answer is clear, concise, and directly addresses the question using the 2022 data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**(Self-Correction during the process):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Initial thought:** Maybe just searching \"3M capital intensity\" will give a direct answer.\n",
      "* **Correction:**  Direct answers might be biased or lack supporting data.  It's better to rely on financial data and make an informed judgment.\n",
      "* **Initial thought:**  Just looking at CapEx is enough.\n",
      "* **Correction:**  Comparing CapEx to revenue and looking at the balance sheet provides a more comprehensive picture.\n",
      "* **Initial thought:**  Any manufacturing company is automatically capital-intensive.\n",
      "* **Correction:** While generally true, the *degree* of capital intensity varies.  Comparing ratios is crucial.Assistant:\n",
