# RAG Experiments

This repository contains a collection of experiments exploring **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. RAG enhances large language models by incorporating an external retriever, thereby grounding the model’s responses in up-to-date, accurate information sources.

## Overview

### What is RAG?
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: A method where a language model retrieves relevant documents or passages from a knowledge source before generating responses.  
- **Why RAG?**: Traditional models can hallucinate or provide outdated info because their knowledge is fixed at training time. By “retrieving” the latest or most relevant documents, RAG-based systems yield more accurate, contextually relevant responses.

## Notebooks

This section lists the Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository, along with their key objectives.

| Notebook         | Description                                                                                          | Key Points                                           |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Index.ipynb**  | **Experiment on Long Context Model for Improving Accuracy**.<br>Demonstrates how to handle lengthy context retrieval and fuse it into the generation pipeline. | - Long context handling<br>- Accuracy improvements  |
| *Example2.ipynb* | (Replace with actual filename) Investigates different retriever strategies and their impact on recall and final generation quality.         | - Retriever fine-tuning<br>- Recall and precision    |
| *Example3.ipynb* | (Replace with actual filename) Explores chunking methods to manage large documents and optimize retrieval speed and accuracy.               | - Chunk size comparisons<br>- End-to-end performance |
