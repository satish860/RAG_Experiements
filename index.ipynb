    "You are a specialized Financial Analysis AI focused on extracting concise, data-driven insights from financial documents. Provide short, precise answers with a brief explanation of your reasoning (thinking process). Follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy & Notation**  \n",
    "   - Present exact numeric values with proper units (e.g., $1.5B, 15%).  \n",
    "   - Maintain precision; use standard financial terminology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context & Citations**  \n",
    "   - Cite specific pages/sources (e.g., [PG:X, Source: DocumentName]) and relevant fiscal periods.  \n",
    "   - Clearly distinguish between Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Metrics & Trends**  \n",
    "   - Prioritize critical KPIs and ratios (e.g., revenue, profit margins).  \n",
    "   - Compare current figures to previous periods (YoY changes) when possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Brief Analytical Structure**  \n",
    "   - Begin with key figures (bullet points).  \n",
    "   - Provide a short thinking process (a few bullets) for how you reached conclusions.  \n",
    "   - End with a concise final answer or insight.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Gaps & Risks**  \n",
    "   - Note missing data, adjustments, unusual items, or restatements.  \n",
    "   - Mention relevant risk disclosures or one-time events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Regulatory & Compliance**  \n",
    "   - Specify if figures follow GAAP/IFRS.  \n",
    "   - Flag any compliance or restatement issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**:  \n",
    "- Stick strictly to information from the documents.  \n",
    "- Keep responses focused on numerical data and short insights.  \n",

      "## Is 3M a Capital-Intensive Business Based on FY2022 Data?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Yes.**\n",

      "* **High Capital Expenditures:** 3M's capital expenditures (CapEx) for FY2022 were $1,749 million [PG:39, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf].  This signifies a substantial investment in property, plant, and equipment.\n",
      "* **Significant Property, Plant, and Equipment:**  The net book value of 3M's property, plant, and equipment at the end of FY2022 was $9.178 billion [PG:50, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf], indicating a high level of fixed assets.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Key Figures:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Operating income margin decreased 1.7% year-over-year (YoY) from 20.8% in 2021 to 19.1% in 2022. [PG:27, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf]\n",
      "\n",
      "**Change Drivers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Significant litigation costs:**  Net costs for significant litigation (respirator mask/asbestos, PFAS-related, Combat Arms Earplugs) negatively impacted the margin. [PG:27, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf]  These totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax. [PG:19, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf]\n",
      "* **Raw material and logistics cost inflation:**  Higher raw material and logistics costs due to geopolitical and supply chain challenges further reduced margins. [PG:21, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf], [PG:27, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf]\n",
      "* **Manufacturing headwinds:**  Production interruptions at the Zwijndrecht, Belgium site and ongoing global supply chain issues negatively affected operating income margin.

      "* **Investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability:** These investments, while beneficial long-term, reduced short-term margins. [PG:21, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf], [PG:27, Source: c:\\Source\\Finance_Bench\\3M_2022_10K.pdf]\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The decrease in 3M's operating income margin in FY2022 was primarily due to substantial litigation costs, raw material inflation, manufacturing disruptions, and investments in growth initiatives, partially mitigated by increased selling prices.  The provided data doesn't suggest operating margin is an unsuitable measure for this company; in fact, 3M uses it extensively in its analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      "* **Quick Ratio Definition:** The quick ratio is a liquidity measure calculated as (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities.  It is useful because it focuses on the most liquid assets readily convertible to cash.\n",
