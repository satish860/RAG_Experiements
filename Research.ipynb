    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Traditional research workflows often face several limitations:\n",
    "- Lack of depth in information gathering and analysis\n",
    "- Inconsistent research methodology across different topics\n",
    "- Limited context retention during complex research tasks\n",
    "- Manual effort in synthesizing information from multiple sources\n",
    "- Difficulty in maintaining research coherence across multiple subtopics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an innovative solution that overcomes these limitations by implementing an advanced research orchestration system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Architecture\n",
    "Our implementation leverages a coordinated group of Large Language Models (LLMs), each specialized for different aspects of the research process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Planner (Deepseek)**: \n",
    "   - Analyzes research queries\n",
    "   - Breaks down complex topics into structured subtasks\n",
    "   - Creates detailed research execution plans\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Research Executor (Claude)**:\n",
    "   - Executes the planned research steps\n",
    "   - Manages tool interactions\n",
    "   - Synthesizes information from multiple sources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Retrieval (Perplexity AI)**:\n",
    "   - Performs targeted web searches\n",
    "   - Extracts relevant information\n",
    "   - Maintains citation tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Implementation\n",
    "This notebook implements the core research flow with:\n",
    "- Multi-LLM orchestration\n",
    "- Structured research planning\n",
    "- Web-based information retrieval\n",
    "- Citation management\n",
    "- Research synthesis and reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Improvements\n",
    "The system is designed to be enhanced with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities:\n",
    "- Integration of domain-specific knowledge bases\n",
    "- Custom vector stores for improved context retention\n",
    "- Semantic search for better information retrieval\n",
    "- Dynamic document chunking and embedding\n",
    "- Hybrid search combining dense and sparse retrievers\n"
